# GDtpArchive
Archiving of my gd texture pack ipa files
method 1. use decrypted geometry dash iPA by Camila314. she fixed the iOS 15/16 crashing issues and rebuild iPA.

download 'medium' graphics from youtube or whatever
extract zip file
install gd ipa
copy and paste the whole texture to the iPA
iPA located at /var/containers/Bundle/Application/Geometry
replace all.
use pid to decrypt (troll decryptor method)
or rename the geometry folder as 'payload'
and zip archive. 
change the folder format as iPA from zip
install with trollstore or esign, etc (that can sideload and inject to your idevice)
